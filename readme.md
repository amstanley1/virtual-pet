In this virtual pet simulation, you are out in the woods and find a horse.
You take the horse home, name it, and care for it.

The horse will have hunger, sleepiness, and boredom. These stats will range from 1 - 10. You will want to prevent
the levels from getting too high, i.e. if the horse's hunger level is high, feed it to lower it, if it's boredom level is high, play with it or
put it in the pasture to lower it. If the horse's sleep level gets high it will go to sleep on it's own. If the horse gets too hungry, it will
run away.

When you feed the horse you can select which food you would like to feed it. It will eat more of food it likes, and less of the food it doesn't.
